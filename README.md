Description
-----------

Based on the amazing sphere.js plugin of Sam Hasler, jquery.earth3d.js is an open source jquery plugin which will allow you to emulate a 3d earth (or any planet actually) on canvas. I also added some functionalities I needed for my pet project.

Here are the main functionality provided so far:
* Change the map texture (you can change it to mars for example)
* Change the rotation axis (tilt, turn)
* Change the size
* Change the default rotation speed
* Smooth mouse drag: you can rotate the earth with your mouse, it will smoothly return to the normal speed
* Render locations by indicating spherical coordinates
* Draw paths between these locations
* Draw and update flights following paths
* Location and flights are clickable and entirely customizable

Licence
-------
jquery.earth3d.js is, as the sphere.js plugin, under MIT licence.
